# Stitching-of-Como-Photos
The reposotirory contains an Jupyter Notebook main.ipynb which provide the code of the process of stitching a pair of custom images taken at Como Lake, which have a partial overlap. The goal is to:
-Extract keypoints and find matches,
-Find the homography which describes the transformation from the second set of kaypoints to the first one
-Apply the homography to the second image
-Integrate with the first image
